          My name is Micheal Okechukwu, I run an Agro-value chain known as Anotu
          Ventures. I had the opportunity to be part of the Bizpotta Business
          Lounge and it has helped impact my business decisions positively.
          Hearing the business journeys of seasoned business people in the
          Lounge helped me recognize and exploit hidden opportunities in my
          field. This has led to a leap in our business growth. (CEO, Anotu
          Ventures)
