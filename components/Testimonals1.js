            Hello, I’m Jane Ebong -Founder of ‘Tabitha Dor’ a faith-based
            fashion brand. My time at the Bizpotta Business Lounge helped to
            further open up my mind to the lean and strategic funding
            possibilities that are available when critical thinking is engaged
            at very defining moments in business growth. I believe I’m currently
            at such a time, and by God’s grace, I have been able to identify a
            way forward. All thanks to the Bizpotta experience!
